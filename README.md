# MIX Simulator and Assembler 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thkim1011/MIX.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thkim1011/MIX)
## About
This is a project I began because I was reading The Art of Computer Programming (I recommend this book for anyone who's interested in both mathematics and computer science) In this book, the language that is used is MIX Assembly Language, or MIXAL, which is used for the hypothetical computer called MIX (exciting right?). Well, I finally finished the large section on mathematical preliminaries and reached the section introducing MIX and MIXAL, but... I had no access to the internet, and the book is pretty hard, so I decided to create... this! 

## Status
Currently, the assembler works (as in if you have a file with no bugs, it might work), but I have not made the simulator yet. I'm currently in the process of catching errors in the assembly process.

## Usage
In the terminal or command prompt, type `java assemble FILENAME`.
Once I make the simulator, you should be able to run `java MIX FILENAME` to automatically assemble the program and load the simulator. I'll eventually learn how to make a batch file and make this more convenient. 

## To do
* Make a simulator.
* ~~Learn how to use git properly.~~
* Learn how to use Gradle
* Learn how to use Travis CI

## Disclaimer
When I first started this, I did this off of only knowledge of programming and absolutely no knowledge of assemblers. This may be very unconventionally programmed (e.g. are you supposed to check for errors before or as you assemble? I went with the latter).

## LOL
I'm honestly surprised that I even came this far.
