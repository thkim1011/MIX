# TO DO
* Finish all classes that implements AtomicExpression
* Implement Future variables (which is going to be pretty hard)
* here should be a part where Expression constructor attempts to evaluate the string and convert to one of Number, DefinedSymbol, or Asterick. Find this spot and actually make this work.

Note to self: make sure to save address to insert nodes for implementing future references.
